# Admin Repository Account Request Implementation Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to Replit AI in your **admin repository**:

---

## Goal
I need you to implement a complete system to handle additional account requests from existing users. When a user requests a new account type, admins should be able to review and approve/reject these requests. Upon approval, the system should automatically create the new account and its associated debit card.

## Backend Implementation Required

### 1. Create Admin API Endpoint for Account Requests
Create a new API endpoint at `pages/api/admin/account-requests.js` (or similar structure in your admin repo) with the following functionality:

**GET endpoint** - Fetch all pending account requests:
- Query the `account_requests` table from the frontend database
- Filter by status ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')
- Join with user information to show who requested it
- Return account requests with user details

**POST endpoint** - Approve or reject account requests:
- Accept `request_id`, `action` ('approve' or 'reject'), and optional `rejection_reason`
- If approved:
  1. Create a new account in the `accounts` table with the requested account type
  2. Generate a new debit card in the `cards` table linked to the new account
  3. Update the `account_requests` table status to 'approved'
  4. Send a confirmation email to the user notifying them of approval
- If rejected:
  1. Update the `account_requests` table status to 'rejected' with the reason
  2. Send an email to the user explaining the rejection

### 2. Database Queries Needed
The endpoint should interact with these tables:

**account_requests table** (already exists in frontend):
- `id`, `user_id`, `account_type`, `status`, `requested_at`, `processed_at`, `rejection_reason`

**accounts table**:
- Create new account with: `user_id`, `account_type`, `account_number` (generate unique), `balance` (0.00), `status` ('active')

**cards table**:
- Create new debit card with: `user_id`, `account_id`, `card_number` (generate unique), `card_type` ('debit'), `status` ('active'), `cvv` (generate), `expiry_date` (set to 5 years from now)

### 3. Admin Dashboard UI Component
Create a new page or section in your admin dashboard to display and manage account requests:

**Table/List View** showing:
- User name and email
- Requested account type
- Request date
- Current status
- Action buttons (Approve/Reject for pending requests)

**Action Modal** for processing requests:
- Display user details and request information
- For rejection: text area for rejection reason
- Confirm and Cancel buttons

### 4. Email Notifications
Implement email sending for:

**Approval Email Template**:
```
Subject: Your Additional Account Request Has Been Approved

Dear [User Name],

Great news! Your request for a [Account Type] account has been approved.

Your new account details:
- Account Number: [Generated Account Number]
- Account Type: [Account Type]
- Debit Card Number: [Masked Card Number ending in XXXX]

You can now access your new account from your dashboard.

Best regards,
Oakline Bank Team
```

**Rejection Email Template**:
```
Subject: Account Request Status Update

Dear [User Name],

We regret to inform you that your request for a [Account Type] account could not be approved at this time.

Reason: [Rejection Reason]

If you have any questions, please contact our support team.

Best regards,
Oakline Bank Team
```

### 5. Helper Functions Needed

**Generate Account Number**:
- Format: 10-digit unique number
- Ensure uniqueness by checking against existing accounts

**Generate Card Number**:
- Format: 16-digit card number (use Luhn algorithm for validity)
- Generate CVV: 3-digit random number
- Set expiry date: Current date + 5 years

**Generate Card Details**:
- Return object with card_number, cvv, expiry_date

## Security Requirements
- All endpoints must verify admin authentication
- Use proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Validate all input data
- Use transactions for atomic operations (create account + card together)

## Expected Flow
1. User submits account request from frontend
2. Request appears in admin dashboard as 'pending'
3. Admin reviews request details
4. Admin clicks Approve or Reject
5. If approved: System creates account + card, sends approval email
6. If rejected: System updates status, sends rejection email with reason
7. User receives email notification
8. User sees new account in their dashboard (if approved)

## Database Connection
Use the same Supabase connection details as the frontend repository since both databases are the same.

Please implement all of the above components in the admin repository, ensuring proper error handling, validation, and user feedback.
