# Selfie/Video Verification System - Backend Admin Panel Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides the prompts you should give to Replit AI in your **backend repository** to create a complete admin panel for managing selfie/video verifications.

---

## Database Migration (Already Created in Frontend)

The frontend migration `create_selfie_verification_system.sql` has already been created. Run this migration in your backend database to create the necessary tables and functions:

- `selfie_verifications` table
- Updated `profiles` table with verification fields
- Helper functions for triggering and managing verifications

---

## Prompts for Backend Admin Panel

### Prompt 1: Create Admin Verification Dashboard Page

```
Create an admin dashboard page for managing selfie/video verifications at /admin/verifications with the following features:

1. Display all verification requests in a table with these columns:
   - User ID and Email
   - Verification Type (selfie/video)
   - Status (pending, submitted, under_review, approved, rejected, expired)
   - Reason for verification requirement
   - Submitted date
   - Actions (View, Approve, Reject)

2. Add filtering options:
   - Filter by status
   - Filter by verification type
   - Search by user email or ID
   - Date range filter

3. Add statistics cards at the top showing:
   - Total pending verifications
   - Total submitted (awaiting review)
   - Total approved today
   - Total rejected today

4. Include pagination (20 items per page)

5. Use the existing admin authentication middleware to protect this route

The API endpoint should query the `selfie_verifications` table joined with the `profiles` table to get user information.
```

---

### Prompt 2: Create Verification Review Modal/Page

```
Create a verification review page/modal at /admin/verifications/[id] with the following features:

1. Display user information:
   - Full name
   - Email
   - User ID
   - Account status
   - Verification reason

2. Display verification details:
   - Type (selfie or video)
   - Submission timestamp
   - Expiration date
   - Current status

3. Media viewer:
   - For selfies: Display the uploaded image with zoom capability
   - For videos: Display video player with playback controls
   - Download button for the media file

4. Admin actions:
   - Approve button (with optional notes field)
   - Reject button (requires rejection reason)
   - Admin notes textarea
   - View user's account history button

5. When approved:
   - Update verification status to 'approved'
   - Set reviewed_by to current admin ID
   - Update user profile to remove verification requirement
   - Send email notification to user

6. When rejected:
   - Update verification status to 'rejected'
   - Keep verification requirement active
   - Send email notification with rejection reason
   - Allow admin to create a new verification request

Use the existing helper functions:
- approve_verification(verification_id, admin_notes)
- reject_verification(verification_id, rejection_reason, admin_notes)
```

---

### Prompt 3: Create API to Trigger Verification for Suspicious Activity

```
Create an API endpoint at /api/admin/require-verification that allows admins to flag users for verification when suspicious activity is detected:

Method: POST
Auth: Admin only

Request body:
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "reason": "string (e.g., 'Suspicious transaction pattern detected')",
  "verification_type": "selfie" | "video" (default: selfie)
}

Actions:
1. Validate admin permissions
2. Check if user exists
3. Call the database function require_user_verification(user_id, reason, verification_type)
4. Send email notification to user with verification instructions
5. Log the action in audit_logs table

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "verification_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Verification requirement created successfully"
}

Error handling:
- 400 if user_id is invalid
- 404 if user not found
- 403 if not admin
- 500 for database errors
```

---

### Prompt 4: Create Automated Verification Trigger System

```
Create a background service/API endpoint that automatically triggers verification requirements based on suspicious activity patterns:

Triggers for automatic verification:
1. Multiple failed login attempts from different locations (>5 in 24 hours)
2. Large transactions above $10,000 in a single day
3. Multiple rapid withdrawals within 1 hour
4. Login from new country/IP address with immediate large transfer
5. Change of email/phone followed by large transaction within 24 hours

Implementation:
- Create an API endpoint /api/admin/auto-verify-triggers
- Add configuration table for trigger rules and thresholds
- When triggered, automatically call require_user_verification() function
- Send notification to both user and admin team
- Log all auto-triggered verifications

Include:
- Admin page to view auto-triggered verifications
- Ability to configure trigger thresholds
- Option to enable/disable specific triggers
- Dashboard showing trigger statistics
```

---

### Prompt 5: Create Email Notification Templates

```
Create email notification templates for the verification system:

1. Verification Required Email (sent to user when flagged):
   - Subject: "Identity Verification Required - Oakline Bank"
   - Content: Explain why verification is needed, steps to complete, deadline (7 days)
   - Include direct link to verification page
   - Support contact information

2. Verification Submitted Email (sent when user submits):
   - Subject: "Verification Submitted - Under Review"
   - Content: Confirmation of submission, expected review timeline (24-48 hours)
   - What happens next

3. Verification Approved Email:
   - Subject: "Identity Verified - Account Access Restored"
   - Content: Confirmation of approval, account access restored
   - Thank you message

4. Verification Rejected Email:
   - Subject: "Verification Review - Additional Information Needed"
   - Content: Reason for rejection, instructions to resubmit
   - Support contact for questions

Use the bank_details table for email configuration and contact information.
Use Nodemailer or your existing email service for sending.
```

---

### Prompt 6: Create Admin Activity Log for Verifications

```
Create an admin activity log system specifically for verification actions:

Table: verification_audit_log
- id (uuid)
- verification_id (uuid, references selfie_verifications)
- admin_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- action_type (text: 'triggered', 'approved', 'rejected', 'viewed', 'downloaded_media')
- previous_status (text)
- new_status (text)
- reason (text)
- notes (text)
- ip_address (text)
- user_agent (text)
- created_at (timestamp)

Admin page at /admin/verifications/audit-log showing:
- All verification-related admin actions
- Filter by admin, action type, date range
- Export to CSV functionality
- Search by user email or verification ID

This provides accountability and tracking for all verification decisions.
```

---

### Prompt 7: Create Bulk Verification Management

```
Create bulk action capabilities for managing multiple verifications:

Features:
1. Bulk approve (with confirmation dialog)
2. Bulk reject (requires common rejection reason)
3. Bulk assign to specific admin reviewer
4. Export selected verifications to CSV

Admin page at /admin/verifications/bulk-actions with:
- Checkbox selection for verifications
- Dropdown for bulk action type
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Progress indicator for bulk operations
- Results summary after completion

Include validation to prevent:
- Approving already rejected verifications
- Rejecting already approved verifications
- Bulk actions on expired verifications without review
```

---

### Prompt 8: Create Verification Analytics Dashboard

```
Create an analytics dashboard at /admin/verifications/analytics showing:

Metrics:
1. Verification volume trends (chart)
   - Submissions per day/week/month
   - Approval/rejection rates
   - Average review time

2. Trigger source breakdown:
   - Manual admin triggers
   - Automated system triggers
   - Breakdown by trigger reason

3. Admin performance metrics:
   - Verifications reviewed per admin
   - Average review time per admin
   - Approval/rejection rates per admin

4. User compliance metrics:
   - Percentage of users who submit within deadline
   - Average time to submission after requirement
   - Resubmission rates after rejection

Charts and visualizations:
- Line charts for trends
- Pie charts for breakdowns
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Date range selector

Export all data to CSV/PDF for reporting.
```

## Integration with Existing Admin Panel

### Adding Navigation Menu Item

```
Add a new menu item to your existing admin navigation:

Label: "Verifications"
Icon: Shield/Check icon
Route: /admin/verifications
Badge: Show count of pending verifications
Submenu:
  - Dashboard (/admin/verifications)
  - Review Queue (/admin/verifications/queue)
  - Analytics (/admin/verifications/analytics)
  - Audit Log (/admin/verifications/audit-log)
  - Settings (/admin/verifications/settings)
```

---

## API Endpoints Summary

Create these API endpoints in your backend:

1. `GET /api/admin/verifications` - List all verifications with filters
2. `GET /api/admin/verifications/:id` - Get single verification details
3. `POST /api/admin/verifications/approve` - Approve verification
4. `POST /api/admin/verifications/reject` - Reject verification
5. `POST /api/admin/require-verification` - Manually trigger verification
6. `GET /api/admin/verifications/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
7. `POST /api/admin/verifications/bulk-action` - Perform bulk actions
8. `GET /api/admin/verifications/analytics` - Get analytics data
9. `GET /api/admin/verifications/media/:id` - Serve verification media file
10. `GET /api/admin/verifications/audit-log` - Get audit log entries

---

## Security Considerations

Ensure all admin endpoints:
1. Use admin authentication middleware
2. Validate admin role permissions
3. Log all actions in audit trail
4. Sanitize user inputs
5. Use RLS policies for database queries
6. Encrypt media files in storage
7. Set appropriate CORS policies
8. Rate limit API endpoints

---

## Storage Configuration

For Supabase Storage (verification-media bucket):

```sql
-- Create storage bucket policy
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view verification media"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'verification-media' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.admin_profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload verification media"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'verification-media' AND
  auth.uid() = (storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid
);
```

---

## Testing Checklist

After implementing, test:
- [ ] Admin can view all verification requests
- [ ] Admin can approve verification (removes user's verification requirement)
- [ ] Admin can reject verification (user stays flagged)
- [ ] User receives email notifications
- [ ] Media files display correctly
- [ ] Filtering and search work properly
- [ ] Bulk actions function correctly
- [ ] Analytics show accurate data
- [ ] Audit log captures all actions
- [ ] Auto-triggers activate on suspicious activity
- [ ] Expired verifications are handled correctly

---

## Quick Start Commands

Once you've given these prompts to Replit AI in your backend:

1. Run the migration in your backend database
2. Restart your backend server
3. Navigate to /admin/verifications as an admin user
4. Test the full verification workflow

---

## Support and Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- **Media not loading**: Check storage bucket permissions
- **Emails not sending**: Verify Nodemailer configuration
- **Auto-triggers not working**: Check background job scheduler
- **Permission denied**: Verify admin_profiles table has your user

---

## Example Usage Flow

1. Admin notices suspicious activity on user account
2. Admin goes to user's profile and clicks "Require Verification"
3. System flags user, creates verification request, sends email
4. User logs in and is redirected to /verify-identity
5. User records selfie/video and submits
6. Admin receives notification of new submission
7. Admin reviews media in /admin/verifications/[id]
8. Admin approves or rejects with notes
9. User receives notification and regains access (if approved)
10. All actions are logged in audit trail
