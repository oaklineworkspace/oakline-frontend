I’m building Oakline Bank, which currently has only one branch. Here are the branch details:

- Branch Name: Oakline Bank – Oklahoma City Branch
- Address: 12201 N. May Avenue, Oklahoma City, OK 73120
- Phone/Text: +1 (636) 635-6122
- Email aliases: info@theoaklinebank.com, welcome@theoaklinebank.com, updates@theoaklinebank.com, contact-us@theoaklinebank.com, notify@theoaklinebank.com
- SMTP host: smtp.zoho.com, port: 465, user: info@theoaklinebank.com, password: <app-password-for-info@>

Requirements for Replit AI:

1. **Do NOT hardcode any sensitive values** (SMTP passwords, API keys, JWT keys, site URLs, Plaid credentials, etc.) in the code.  
   - Use environment variables only. I will set the real values in Replit secrets/deployment secrets.  
2. Add the branch address and phone in the website’s About Us / Contact section.
3. Integrate all email aliases into my Vercel/Supabase deployment using SMTP so the correct alias is used for different email types:
   - Welcome emails → welcome@
   - Account updates → updates@
   - Customer inquiries → contact-us@
   - Transactional notifications → notify@
4. Keep the sender name “Oakline Bank” for all emails.
5. Provide **example code** for sending emails dynamically via Supabase/Vercel, using the environment variables for SMTP credentials.
6. Suggest a professional layout for the website contact section including:
   - Branch address
   - Phone/Text
   - Email links
   - Business hours (optional)
7. Ensure the branch location appears when users search the address online (Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing).
8. Include instructions or example code to test email deliverability to inboxes (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo).
9. Provide a complete `.env.example` file with **placeholders only** for Supabase, SMTP, Plaid, JWT, site URLs, and feature flags. No real values.

The output should include:
- Supabase environment variable setup using environment variables only
- Example email sending code using aliases and environment variables
- Professional About Us / Contact section layout
- Optional tips for testing email delivery
