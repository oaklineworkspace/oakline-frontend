I have a Next.js project with a file at pages/apply.js. This file contains the correct list of account types used in the application form.

I want you to:

1. Extract all account types from apply.js, including the following details for each:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Icon
   - APY or rate
   - Suggested professional minimum deposit (recommend standard U.S. banking practice for each type)
   - Category (Personal, Business, Investment, Specialized, Premium, etc.)

2. Generate a SQL file named account_types.sql for Supabase/PostgreSQL that:
   - Creates a table named account_types with the following columns:
     - id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
     - name TEXT
     - description TEXT
     - icon TEXT
     - rate NUMERIC (or TEXT if the rate is Variable)
     - min_deposit NUMERIC
     - category TEXT
   - Inserts all extracted account types into this table with recommended minimum deposits.

3. For accounts with "Variable" rates (like Investment or Crypto accounts), store the rate as TEXT.

4. For accounts with "N/A" rates (like Prepaid Card or Loan Repayment accounts), set the rate as NULL or 0 and the minimum deposit as $0.

5. Use professional banking standards to recommend reasonable minimum deposits if they are missing or unclear in apply.js. Examples of standard banking practices:
   - Checking accounts: $25–$100
   - Savings accounts: $50–$500
   - Money Market: $2,500+
   - Certificate of Deposit (CD): $500–$1,000
   - Retirement accounts (IRA): $500–$1,000
   - Business accounts: $1,000–$5,000 depending on type
   - Investment accounts: $1,000–$5,000
   - Cryptocurrency accounts: $100–$500
   - Loan repayment accounts or prepaid cards: $0

6. Output the full SQL file content (account_types.sql) with:
   - CREATE TABLE statement
   - INSERT statements for all account types from apply.js

7. Ensure the SQL file is ready to run directly in Supabase.

Extra Notes:
- Users should be able to open any account, but if the account requires a minimum deposit, it will remain in pending status until an admin approves it after confirming the deposit.

Please read the apply.js file to extract accurate account names, descriptions, icons, and rates, and generate professional minimum deposits for each account type.
