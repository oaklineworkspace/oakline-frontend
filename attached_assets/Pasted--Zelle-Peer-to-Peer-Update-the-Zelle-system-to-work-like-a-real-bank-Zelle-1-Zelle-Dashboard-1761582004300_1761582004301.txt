🔹 Zelle (Peer-to-Peer)

Update the Zelle system to work like a real bank Zelle:
	1.	Zelle Dashboard
	•	Create a /zelle page with tabs for:
	•	Send Money
	•	Zelle Contacts
	•	Recent Zelle Transactions
	•	Settings
	•	Display the user’s Zelle balance and limits.
	2.	Send Money Flow
	•	When the user enters a receiver’s email or phone, automatically fetch the receiver’s full name from the profiles table.
	•	Show a confirmation modal with:
	•	Receiver Name
	•	Receiver Email
	•	Amount
	•	Memo (optional)
	•	Verification Code field
	•	Before sending money, send a 6-digit verification code to the sender’s registered email (via Supabase or Zoho mail API) to confirm identity.
	•	Only complete the transfer after the code is verified.
	•	Deduct funds from the sender and credit the receiver using the transactions table.
	•	Log everything in zelle_transactions and system_logs.
	3.	Zelle QR Code Scan
	•	Add a “Scan Zelle QR” button that opens the camera and allows scanning a barcode or QR code linked to another user’s Zelle ID.
	•	When scanned, auto-fill the receiver’s email and name.
	•	Use a library like react-qr-reader for the front end.
	4.	Zelle Transactions History
	•	Create a section on /zelle showing the 10 most recent Zelle transactions.
	•	Show details: date, receiver name, amount, status, and type (send/receive).
	•	Color-code:
	•	Green for completed
	•	Orange for pending
	•	Red for failed
	5.	Zelle Settings
	•	Let users set Zelle transfer limits, notification preferences, and linked accounts.
	•	Store these in zelle_settings.

	•	Memo
	•	Validate that both check images are uploaded before submission.
