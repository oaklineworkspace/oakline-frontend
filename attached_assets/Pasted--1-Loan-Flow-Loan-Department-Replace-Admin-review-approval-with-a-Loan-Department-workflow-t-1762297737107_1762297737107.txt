 1. Loan Flow & Loan Department
	•	Replace “Admin review/approval” with a Loan Department workflow throughout the loan system.
	•	All loan requests requiring a 10% deposit should remain Pending until the Loan Department confirms the deposit.
	•	Once approved, the loan should become Active, and the funds should be credited accordingly.
	•	Add email notifications for all major stages:
	•	On submission: “Your loan request is being reviewed by the Loan Department.”
	•	On approval: “Your loan has been approved and activated.”
	•	On rejection: “Your loan request was not approved. Contact support for clarification.”
	•	The payment page should load correctly only after the user selects a crypto network (don’t show “BTC not available” before selection).
	•	When a user completes the 10% deposit, show a professional success page with transaction details.

⚠️ 2. Prevent Duplicate or Fake Deposits
	•	Prevent users from submitting the 10% loan deposit multiple times for the same loan.
	•	Once submitted, disable or hide the “Deposit” button for that loan.
	•	Ensure the backend validates that the user hasn’t already made the deposit.
	•	Update the Loan Details Page:
	•	Detect whether the user already paid the 10% deposit.
	•	If paid, hide the “10% Required” message and instead show something like:
✅ Deposit received. Your loan is under review by the Loan Department.
	•	Maintain strict validation to ensure sincerity and accuracy in all loan deposits.

🧾 4. Apply Page (Location Data)
	•	Extract all countries, states, and cities currently hardcoded in apply.js.
	•	Replace them with dynamic data fetched from Supabase tables.

•	Update apply.js to fetch and populate dropdowns for country → state → city dynamically.
	•	Make sure the user can still select locations smoothly without breaking the form logic.

⸻

💼 5. Loan Application Page Redesign
	•	Make the loan application form professional and easy to understand:
	•	Step-based form with progress indicators.
	•	Add tooltips or short explanations under each field.
	•	Improve typography, spacing, and button alignment.
	•	Ensure minimum deposits, rates, and loan terms are shown clearly and align with standard U.S. banking practices.

⸻

✉️ 6. Notifications and Confirmations
	•	Send email and in-app notifications for:
	•	Loan submission
	•	Deposit confirmation
	•	Loan approval/rejection
	•	Each email should use a professional template with your bank name and logo.

⸻

🔒 7. Optional Enhancements

	When a user submits the 10% loan deposit, automatically tag it as loan_requirement_deposit in Supabase for better tracking.
	•	Use a consistent loan_status system:
	•	pending_deposit, under_review, approved, rejected, active, completed
	•	Make the front-end show status badges accordingly.

⸻

✅ Summary

The goal is to make the loan flow transparent, secure, and professional:
	•	Prevent duplicate 10% deposits.
	•	Show correct status after submission.
	•	Replace Admin with Loan Department workflow.
	•	Improve UI/UX for loans, apply, and dashboard pages.
	•	Dynamically fetch countries/states/cities from Supabase.
