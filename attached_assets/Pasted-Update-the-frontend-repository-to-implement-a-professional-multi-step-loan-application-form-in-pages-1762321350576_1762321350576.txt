Update the frontend repository to implement a professional multi-step loan application form in pages/apply.js with the following features:

1. Multi-Step Form:
   - Step 1: Loan Details
       • loan_type (dropdown, fetch from API)
       • principal (numeric input, > 0)
       • term_months (numeric input, >=1)
       • interest_rate (auto-calculated or user-entered based on loan type)
       • purpose (dropdown, fetch from loan_purposes table)
       • Validate all required fields before moving to next step
   - Step 2: User ID Document Upload
       • Upload front and back images of ID
       • Integrate with Supabase Storage (private bucket)
       • Validate file types (jpg, png) and max size 5MB each
       • Display upload progress and preview images
   - Step 3: Collateral Upload (optional)
       • Collect collateral_type, ownership_type, estimated_value
       • Allow uploading multiple photos/documents
       • Store photo URLs in Supabase Storage and save paths in loan_collaterals table
   - Step 4: Review & Submit
       • Show all entered data and uploaded files for user review
       • Allow editing any step before submission
       • Disable submit button until all required fields/uploads are complete

2. Form Submission:
   - On submit, send a single API request to backend:
       • Create loan application in loans table
       • Save ID document URLs in user_id_documents table
       • Save collateral data in loan_collaterals table
   - Show success or error messages based on API response

3. UI/UX:
   - Clean, responsive, and professional design
   - Real-time validation and error messages
   - Clear step indicators and progress bar
   - Mobile and desktop friendly

4. Integration:
   - Ensure only logged-in users can apply
   - Use signed URLs for previewing uploaded images
   - Store only URLs in database; images remain in Supabase Storage

5. Optional Enhancements:
   - Allow removing/re-uploading ID or collateral images before submission
   - Dynamically show loan terms/disclaimers based on loan_type
   - Persist data when navigating between steps
